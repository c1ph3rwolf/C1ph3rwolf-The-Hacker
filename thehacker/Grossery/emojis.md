> [!done]
> An **emoji** is a small digital image or icon used to express emotions, ideas, objects, or concepts in electronic communication. ^[Emojis are commonly used in text messages, social media posts, emails, and other forms of digital communication to add emotional context or visual interest. They range from smiley faces and gestures to animals, food, and symbols.] ^[The term "emoji" comes from the Japanese words "e" (絵, meaning "picture") and "moji" (文字, meaning "character"). Emojis are standardized across different platforms and devices through the Unicode Consortium, ensuring that they appear similarly no matter where they are used.]
